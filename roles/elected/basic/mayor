Name:Mayor
Desc:If there's ever a tie in the lynch or election vote, the Mayor will be the one to decide, as their vote counts as two. Before a game starts, it should be decided if a Mayor will exist in the game. If the game has a Mayor there are two options to choose from: either the Mayor is only elected once (during the first day) and must choose a successor if they die, or the Mayor is elected during the day whenever there is no living Mayor.
