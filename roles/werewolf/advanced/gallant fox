Name:Gallant Fox
Desc:The Gallant Fox is part of the werewolf team, but does not wake up with the werewolves. Instead, the Gallant Fox may choose a player to protect each night for the current night and the next day (which includes the lynch vote). The werewolves will be made aware who the Gallant Fox has protected - the Host will announce that the Gallant Fox has protected and point at a player. Once per game, the Gallant Fox may choose to change into a werewolf permanently.
Card:The Gallant Fox does not wake up with the other werewolves. Instead, they may choose a player to protect for the night and next day. The werewolves will be made aware. They may also choose to change into a werewolf permanently.
